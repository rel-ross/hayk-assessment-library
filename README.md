Create classes for `Book`, `BookAuthor`, and `Author`. You should be able to:

* Create a book
* Create an author
* Add a book to an author
* Add an author to a book
* Get a list of an author's books
* Get a list of a book's authors

Books and Authors shouldn't be stored in each other's classes (use a single source of truth).
